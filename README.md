# RVPT WEBSITE
This is a Personal Training website designed to help provide information to people new to the fitness industry but more so, help generate leads (potential clients). 

Ideally most users of this website are perhaps considering getting themselves a personal trainer. They will find this website useful, they would have hopefully learned at least one new thing about workouts or nutrition, they would have learnt more about myself and my PT business, but ultimately, they end up completing the enquiry form at the end, in the hopes that they end up becoming a client of mine.

## FEATURES
- The navbar has a logo of the business with a dark background to separate it from the page contents.  
- Just like the navbar, the footer has the same color theme. This color repetition and structure is said to make user experiences better. They like it when a website has a common theme/layout so that it then becomes quick to learn/easy to use. The green color used is supposed to be nice neutral color, but also represent grass and an outdoor feel as my sessions are predominantly delivered in parks.  
- The footer is also being used as a sales point leading users to the enquire page and my social accounts, both designed to help bring in new clients.  
- The first page is naturally the home page. Where users learn about the business. The next page is then all about workouts. As nutrition will partly depend on the workout style you opt for, people should first know what they want to train, so that when reading the nutrition, they know what they need to prioritise. Lastly, the enquire page, where if users have enjoyed the content and want to take it further and start personal training sessions, they are able to complete a form to begin PT.   
- The Home page is deliberately designed and layed out in this manner, so that the first thing seen is the trainer, the business name and a brief overview of the business. It's supposed to reassure users that this is a legitimate business that they can trust in. Putting a face to the business is one of the first steps in helping users trust the business.  
- It is followed by testimonials to help further the users trust into the business and to provide them with previous client experiences and what they could be receiving too should they sign up to PT.  
- On the workouts page, weightlifting must be first for two reasons. Firstly, I specialise in strength training, so it naturally makes sense to talk about this first. Secondly, there is a lot of misconception regarding weightlifting, so before we go any further, I feel as though this should be clarified.  
- The cardio section will then go next followed by stretching, due to the popularity and importance the two have in my business (cardio being more important).  
- We then move onto the Nutritions page where we talk about the 3 main macronutrients which are the main sources of fuel our body needs. A typical person will need 50% carbs, 30% protein, 20% fats, hence why I presented them in this order.  
- Lastly, the enquire page, summarising why you should train with me, followed by a form to complete if interested in personal training. 
- Each photo is deliberately selected to match with the topic we are talking about. All text is written over the photo relating to that section which we are talking about. I aim to create clear division in topics by having them displayed on different photos. So each photo, is a different topic. This structure stayed consistent throughout to keep the user experience good.
- As this website has many pictures with lots of colors, I wanted to keep the text simple and clear, which is why I opted for a lack of font-awesome icons and a dark shade over photos to aid the reading experience. Plus I feel as though the font-awesome icons would have just been of the same thing as the background image, which I feel there is no need to repeat.  

## UX/UI SECTION  

### Site Goals:
-  The goals of this site is inform users about the Personal Training business, general health and fitness knowledge and ultimately get them to sign up for PT sessions. The site should be easy to navigate through, consistent with design, as well as make users want to visit again. It should be aestetically pleasing with all text being clear to read, all generating a good user experience.  

### Design Choices:
- Black navbar and footer have been choosen to be this color to clearly separate it from the main conents of the page.  
- Green color when hovering is meant to indicate grass as most sessions will be outside at local parks.  
- Colorful photos, with all workout photos being outdoors as this will be the primary location of sessions.  
- Writing over photos to help keep sections seperate with a clear image relating to the topic.  
- Ubuntu font selected as I feel as though it has a similar feel to the logo font used.  
- PT logo in the enquire section to reminder users that this is a legitimate company, while also providing a clear display of the logo as it is only seen elsewhere in the nav which is rather small.

## UNFIXED BUGS
- Website Viewport issue where there is a thin white trim down the right side of some devices. It becomes more noticeable the smaller the device gets. Although no content is hidden, this needs to be fixed. Need to 'inspect' my website and find the issue.
- Nav Viewport issue for devices 575px screen width or less. The Navbar disappears and users cannot navigate through the page. Can be fixed with a dropdown menu for smaller devices. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Have not had enough time to resolve the issue. Image shows the issue to be resolved.
