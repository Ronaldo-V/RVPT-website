# RVPT WEBSITE

This is a Personal Training website designed to help provide information to people new to the fitness industry but more so, help generate leads (potential clients). 

Ideally most users of this website are perhaps considering getting themselves a personal trainer. They will find this website useful, they would have hopefully learned at least one new thing about workouts or nutrition, they would have learnt more about myself and my PT business, but ultimately, they end up completing the enquiry form at the end, in the hopes that they end up becoming a client of mine.

## CREDIT
In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
